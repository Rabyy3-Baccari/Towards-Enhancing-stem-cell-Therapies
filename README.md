## Overview
This project leverages AI and machine learning to enhance stem cell therapy outcomes. By identifying protein biomarkers and assessing colony health, it aims to improve the precision of stem cell differentiation, reducing inefficiencies and risks of tumorigenesis in therapeutic applications. The project includes models for cell health assessment and differentiation prediction, as well as data preprocessing and visualization tools.

## Introduction
The discovery of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) introduced the potential for regenerative therapies, though it raised ethical concerns and the risk of immune rejection. In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka's breakthrough in developing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) addressed many ethical concerns and reduced immune rejection risks by reprogramming adult cells. However, iPSCs introduced new challenges, including inefficiencies, genetic abnormalities, and risks of tumorigenesis.

This project leverages AI and machine learning to enhance stem cell therapy by addressing these challenges. Through health detection and differentiation prediction models, we aim to improve the therapeutic application of stem cells in regenerative medicine.

## First Model: Stem Cell Colony Health Detection

### Dataset
This model uses data described in the paper [Evaluating Cell Processes, Quality, and Biomarkers in Pluripotent Stem Cells Using Video Bioinformatics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26848582/), which introduces **StemCellQC**, a video bioinformatics tool for analyzing human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) colonies. This tool tracks 24 morphological and dynamic features over 48-hour time-lapse videos of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), assessing aspects such as growth, motility, and cell death. Healthy colonies exhibit robust growth and minimal cell death, while unhealthy colonies display irregular growth and increased cell death. This real-time analysis provides critical insights into stem cell colony viability, essential for regenerative medicine and research.

### Model Pipeline
The pipeline for assessing stem cell colony health follows a series of steps designed to extract features and classify colony viability using machine learning models:

## Second Model: Stem Cell Differentiation Prediction

### Dataset
This model is trained on:
- **RNA sequences of stem cells** from the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR914288)
- **Protein sequences** from the [Uniprot Database](https://www.uniprot.org/)

These datasets enable the model to identify specific biomarkers (such as the ROR2 protein) that influence differentiation paths, providing insights into stem cell potential for specific therapeutic applications.

### Model Pipeline
The pipeline for differentiation prediction utilizes bioinformatics and machine learning to analyze RNA and protein sequences, aiming to predict the differentiation trajectory of stem cells.
